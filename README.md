# Build-and-Automate-a-Python-ETL-pipeline-with-airflow-on-AWS-EC2
Built and automated an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, transform it, and load it into AWS S3. Implemented DAGs, Operators, and Sensors for workflow orchestration, deploying entirely on AWS to gain hands-on experience in cloud-based data engineering.
